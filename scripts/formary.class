!! in case you want to use the lastest class version to modify the frequency of the data obtained with PMO-13.7m 
!! You have to read the rest frequency and reference channel from the observation log of PMO-13.7m
!!

!!!!!!!! This is an example !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

file in try3.sdd                !! read the data 
set variable SPECTRO write      !! allow to correct for the head of the spectra
find 
sic delete formary.14m 
file out formary.14m single
for i 1 to found 
get next
modify doppler 0                !! already LSR corrected  
let r%head%SPE%restf 86847.01   !! rest frequency in the 
let r%head%SPE%rchan 6996.4

write 
next 



file in formary.14m 
find 
aver 
modify freq 86754.28840         !! frequency for other lines, H13CO+(1-0) here
